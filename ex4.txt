Since q_a, q_b and p_ab are probabilities, they are larger or equal to 0 and smaller or equal to 1.
It is known that the set [0, 1] is closed under multiplication and the set (0, 1] is closed under division.
If p_ab is assumed to be non-zero, then the division is something in the set [0, 1].
That means, that the logarithm of the division is something smaller or equal to zero.
Since the product of probabilities is positive, the whole summand is smaller or equal to zero.
Sum of numbers that are smaller or equal to zero is smaller or equal to zero.
Inverse of a number that is smaller or equal to zero is larger or equal to zero, that is, it is non-negative QED.
